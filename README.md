# Django Web-Poll app
### I am working on the official Django web-poll app tutorial.

* This tutorial was sufficient to get to know about the basics of how Django works.
* I studied about a lot of terms which initially felt quite strange to me.
* I got to know about Templates, Views, url dispatcher, http-related terms like HttpRequest and HttpResponse.
